## Expenses

  Minimum monthly expenses = `$3000/mo`

  `$3000/mo` * `12mo` = `$36,000/yr`

  - Add `10-15%` unforeseen bills
  - Add `25-50%` personal expenses
  - Add `25-30%` taxes


  - `$36,000/yr` + `15%` = `$41,400/yr`
  - `$41,400/yr` + `25%` = `$51,750/yr`
  - `$51,750/yr` + `30%` = `$67,275/yr`

  total expenses: `$67,275/yr`


## Work Days

  Out of `261` work days/yr

  - Subtract  `5-10` holidays
  - Subtract `10-20` vacation
  - Subtract  `5-10` sick days

  `261` work days/yr - `40` days = `221 total work days/yr`


## Daily rate

  Total expenses / total work days/yr
  For time estimation.

  `$67,275/yr` / `221 work days/yr`

                Expert = $304.41/day
    Intermediate - 10% = $273.97/day
           Entry - 25% = $228.32/day ***Minimum profitable rate***


## Hourly rate

  Daily rate / 8 hours
  Consultation, appointments, and getting an annoying client off your ass.


                Expert = $38.05/hr
    Intermediate - 10% = $34.25/hr
           Entry - 25% = $28.54/hr ***Minimum profitable rate***


## Revisions

  Hourly rate + `25%`
  Number of revisions must be specified in the contract.

          Expert = $47.56/hr
    Intermediate = $42.81/hr
           Entry = $35.68/hr


## Rush jobs

  Additional `50%-100%`
  Make sure client knows the percentage goes up the faster they want something.

          Expert = $57.07 - $76.10/hr    or    $456.62 - $608.82/day
    Intermediate = $51.38 - $68.50/hr    or    $410.96 - $547.94/day
           Entry = $42.81 - $57.08/hr    or    $342.48 - $456.64/day ***Minimum profitable rate***


## Per asset rate

  Hourly rate plus a percentage to make it worth your time.
  Lower percentage for large orders of small assets.


## Asshole rate

  What you charge for jobs you simply do not want to do.
  At least twice your usual rate, itemize any costs for additional time,
  materials, research, etc. Use your hourly rate for any itemized additions.
