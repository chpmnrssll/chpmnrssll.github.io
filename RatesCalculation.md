## Expenses

  Minimum monthly expenses = `$3000/mo`

  `$3000/mo` * `12mo` = `$36,000/yr`

  - Add `10-15%` unforeseen bills
  - Add `25-50%` personal expenses
  - Add `25-30%` taxes


  - `$36,000/yr` + `15%` = `$41,400/yr`
  - `$41,400/yr` + `25%` = `$51,750/yr`
  - `$51,750/yr` + `30%` = `$67,275/yr`

  total expenses: `$67,275/yr`


## Work Days

  Out of `261` work days/yr

  - Subtract  `5-10` holidays
  - Subtract `10-20` vacation
  - Subtract  `5-10` sick days

  `261` work days/yr - `40` days = `221 total work days/yr`
