While freelancing is great and I enjoy working independently, I'm currently looking for a more long term role and am interested in joining your team. I have experience in most of your requirements, including: several front-end frameworks, Git, Docker, and CI/CD services. I've even successfully setup libvirt and virt-manager on an Arch/Manjaro Linux machine to run the MS-WIN10-EDGE virtual machine for cross-browser testing.

About the only thing I don't know much about is your Elastic Stack. I've become fairly adept at "jumping stacks" from the widely varying projects on upWork and am always ready to learn something new.

Thanks for your time,
Russ
