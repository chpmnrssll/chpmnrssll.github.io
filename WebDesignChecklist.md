Every time I need to make a design I copy paste this checklist and I follow it in this order.

- [ ] Define the architecture of the information of your website (pure content)
- [ ] Collect inspiration (Dribbble, Awwwards, and favorites sites)
- [ ] Make a shortlist and understand what works well on those inspiration
- [ ] Make a wireframe (on paper)
- [ ] Design the website in grayscale first (you can use your favorite design tool)
- [ ] Select fonts (2 is a good number)
- [ ] Design the logo
- [ ] Define the color palette (it should fit the logo)
- [ ] Improve your design implementing the font, colors, and logo
- [ ] Define animations to implement (you can design them if they are complexe using a software otherwise just keep them in mind, or draw them on paper)
