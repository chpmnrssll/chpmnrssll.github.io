This is a boilerplate for new projects I've been working on using Jekyll with Webpack. I've updated quite a few things from the original to get 100% scores across the board in Google Lighthouse audits. https://github.com/chpmnrssll/jekyll-webpack

This is a version of my demo/portfolio site built with VuePress on GitHub Pages. VuePress is mostly meant for documentation sites, but I've found it works well as a lightweight static site generator and it comes with Vue.js support without much configuration hassle.

Hello, I'm interested in joining your team. It sounds like you use most of my preferred stack too. I've been doing freelance development for quite a while through upWork (and oDesk before that) and have experience working remotely. I'm looking for a more sustainable long-term solution though, and your opening seems to be exactly that. Below are a few open-source related things I've worked on. There's more in my resume, github, and my portfolio site.

## Experience

Feb, 2019

This is a recent full-stack project I worked on that was cancelled.

Initially this project was supposed to be based on https://github.com/jamesaud/VENoM-Docker (I even ended up doing a pull request to fix some bugs in that project before the plan was changed).
It ended up using the MEVN stack (MongoDB, Express, Vue.js, and Node.js) plus a few more client side libraries (Vuetify, VueX, Axios). Most of the front-end is complete and I was finishing the API/DB when it was cancelled.

It's built using the MEVN stack (MongoDB, Express, Vue.js, and Node.js) plus a few more client side libraries (Vuetify, VueX, Axios). The main goal was to have a GUI tool for creating/editing headline images based on multiple layers of images and text with HTML5 Canvas. The back-end API was meant to automate server side rendering of the saved headlines with variable text. Most of the front-end is complete and I was working on the API/DB connections when it was cancelled.
GitHub: https://github.com/chpmnrssll/headline-creation-tool
Demo: https://chpmnrssll.github.io/headline-creation-tool/


This is a Docker development environment based on Vue, Express, Node, and MongoDB that I've contributed to.
This was my original starting point for the "Headline Creation Tool" and required a few bug fixes to address issues with the MongoDB/Mongoose connections. After switching to a plain MEVN stack, I gave the original author my fixes as a PR so it would still be useful to someone in the future. He has an interesting tutorial/article on medium.com about the project.

This was a 10 year old Google Site I converted to Gatsby/React. It retains all of the original meta data, tags, and page routes for search engine ratings and uses Netlify-CMS for managing patient reviews.

Old PHP/SQL content management system. Based on RedHat OpenShift Paas.
https://github.com/chpmnrssll/old

This was meant to be the back-end for a multiplayer game that never got off the ground. The simple front-end and api code for user management was all finished though. (Uses passport.js for oAuth)

This is the last commercial project I worked on with PHP. It's a WordPress site and custom plugin for the Mississippi Court Reporters Association. The plugin was meant to be a replacement for default user profile system and adds admin dashboard controls along with a public member directory. I was responsible for all of the code and theme based on designs from Like Minds Design. There's more info and screenshots available at this link to my site: https://chpmnrssll.github.io/advanced-static-site/about/2018/01/28/MCRA.html

## JAMstack

Here's some info on the static site generators I've worked with.
- Jekyll is based on Ruby on Rails and is the default static site generator supported by GitHub Pages.
- Gatsby is Node/GraphQL based and uses React.js on the front-end.
- Nuxt.js is a Node based static site generator that uses Vue.js on the front-end.
- VuePress is also based on Node and Vue.js. It's mostly meant for documentation sites, but it works as a lightweight static site generator without much configuration.

CMS
- prose.io is a simple content editor that works directly on a GitHub repository.
- forestry.io is a more advanced git based content management system.
- netlify-cms is git based, has a admin authorization controls, paid support, more features...

The Node/JavaScript generators should be simple to update in the future. Nuxt.js and Vue.js does seem to be a little easier to work with than React though. I wouldn't go with Hugo unless you are already comfortable with the Go programming language. Hopefully that'll help you get a better idea of what you need.

## The benefits of Docker Compose

Using Docker and defining your local development environment with Docker Compose provides you with a number of benefits:

- By running Node.js and MongoDB in a Docker container, you don’t have to install or maintain the software on your local machine
- Your entire local development environment can be checked into source control, making it easier for other developers to collaborate on a project
- You can spin up the entire local development environment with one command: docker-compose up

## Other

Learning to code well requires a lot of patience, a lot of enthusiasm and a lot
of time. As a developer knowing how to phrase search queries, review other
developers’ code, and apply it to the problem that you’re trying to solve.

A big part of freelancing is estimating how long things will take. There will
always be something that will take a massive amount of time to figure out in a
new programming language or framework.

Don’t put yourself in an awkward spot by projecting time for something you don’t
already know. Only agree to freelance work with technologies that you know.

Based on real Hired interview data, Front-end Engineers in Denver earn an
