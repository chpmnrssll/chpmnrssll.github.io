- Are open to talk or meet with me at anytime in person, on Skype, via email etc to ensure I can do my best work for them

## How to fire bad clients

Say yes to the right opportunities, and no to the ones that will not serve you in the long run.

- Be much clearer from the outset on your freelancing terms and conditions (on your website and in your meetings and initial contact)

- State your prices clearly and link this to the value you provide (aim high, so you have room to negotiate)

- Don’t back down if someone tries to bully you, asks you for a heavy discount or won’t pay you up front; that should be a warning sign

- If you really don’t want to work with the client and you can feel it’s not a right fit, state your f#ck off price. If they accept you can make up your mind.

- If in doubt, come back to your checklist, and see if they tick any of the boxes. It will make it much easier to make snap decisions on working with them.


# Ideal Freelancer Checklist

- Create a clear project brief that the client signs off on before we begin work to make sure we’re all on the same page

- Communicate regularly with my client to ensure their expectations are kept in check, and actually exceeded

- Give my client realistic timeframes on the work I’m doing and when I need them to feedback to me by so that all goes smoothly

- Provide a weekly report that details what’s been achieved and what’s left to do so the client feels assured you have their best interests at heart

- Follow up once the contract is complete to make sure they’re truly happy – or better yet thrilled with the outcome

- Set a reminder in your calendar or via your CRM tool to say a friendly hello 2-4 weeks later to show you care

- Send them a personalized card one month later, thanking them for working with you and inviting them to contact you for future projects
